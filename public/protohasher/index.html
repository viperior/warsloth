			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<p>Protohasher uses a primitive algorithm to hash a 4-digit pin code. This allows a system to verify that an entered pin matches the expected hash for that pin, eliminating the need to store the pin as plain text in a database. Due to a flaw in the algorithm, however, Protohasher actually decreases the security of a PIN system. This is due to the fact that it does not take into account the order of digits in a PIN code. So 1234 ends up with an identical hash as 4321, 2341, 3412, etc.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, because it adds up the digits of the pin and uses the sum to produce the hash, many different pins end up producing the same hash. All that is required is that the digits add up to the same number. For example: 1234 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. 2233 = 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 10. Both 1234 and 2233 produce the same hash. A system relying on Protohasher would accept the wrong PIN so long as the sum of the digits match any valid PIN.</p>
			<h2>The Algorithm</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Calculate the sum of the digits of the PIN. 8293 would produce a "pin sum" of 22.</li>
				<li>Using the salt "ba10cEAB3dgf725DCFGh4eH6", get the UTF-16 code of each character. This is an integer between 0 and 65,535. Sum all of these values. This salt produces a "salt sum."</li>
				<li>Multiply the <em>pin sum</em> by the <em>salt sum</em> to get the hashed pin.</li>
			</ol>
